# Project


#### There are a lot of files that we were not able to upload here due to size constraints. You can reach out to us if you want to see those files. This repository includes almost all of the trial and error processes we followed. However in some codes we just comment some part of the code and rewrite another code and run another experiment. So you can also look at those parts.

#### Please reach out to me via email if you have any questions or concerns: melis.fidansoy.ucla@gmail.com
