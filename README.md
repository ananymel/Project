# Project


#### There are a lot of files that we were not able to upload here due to size constraints. You can reach out to us if you want to see those files. This repository includes almost all of the trial and error processes we followed. However in some codes we just comment some part of the code and rewrite another code and run another experiment. So you can also look at those parts.

#### Please reach out to me via email if you have any questions or concerns: melis.fidansoy.ucla@gmail.com


#### If you want to check for our hard work and see additional trial and errors, please check the APPENDIX branch.

#### Most of the works are saved in my own wandb account. However I am not able to share it. If you want to reach out to it and check our work please reach out to me.
